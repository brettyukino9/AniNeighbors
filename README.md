# AniNeighbors

Find what similars on AniList have the most similar taste to you

# Running the script
Enter your username into the config. You may also change the weights for each metric. Then run the script.
Make sure to enter your favorites into the "shared_favorites.csv" file. Use romaji titles, one per line, and comma separated. 

GetUserData can be used to compare yourself against a different group of Anilist users. A premade file I prepared is already in here with 5000 users in it. If you'd like to compare yourself against who you follow rather than my preset users, run GetUserData.py with your profile. It takes about 1 minute for every ~20 users.

The AniNeighbors script currently takes a minute to run with the default file.
